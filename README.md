# Snaks of Snakes 

The main purpouse of this repository is to make the same Snake game in different languages using always raylib because it's a simple and amazing library.

The code is mainly for fun and exercise so it won't be the best and most optimized but I still hope it could be useful for someone starting! 

At the moment the project comprise of these languages:
